`Code Explanation: main.c`

This code performs the `FFT algorithm on an array of complex numbers, x`, `with N elements`.
> The FFT is a fast algorithm that can be used to compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a signal.

In this case, the signal is assumed to be audio samples. The `FFT can be used to extract the frequencies present in the signal`, which is useful for speech recognition applications.

The FFT algorithm works by `recursively splitting the input array into even and odd samples and then combining the results using a process called "butterfly operations."` 

 The resulting FFT output is a set of complex numbers that represent the frequency components of the input signal.

* The readAudioSamples() function is left as an exercise to the reader, as it will depend

`Code Explanation: main_1.c`
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence.`In speech recognition, the FFT can be used to convert a time-domain signal (such as an audio signal) into the frequency domain, which can then be used for further processing and analysis.`

Here is a sample code in C that demonstrates how to perform an FFT on a time-domain signal using the Kiss FFT library:

This code initializes an array of complex numbers in with a sine wave, and then uses the Kiss FFT library to perform an FFT on the input data, storing the result in the array out. The resulting frequency spectrum is then printed to the console.

Note that this is just a simple example to illustrate the basic usage of the FFT in speech recognition. In practice, you may need to pre-process the input data (such as by applying a window function or removing DC bias) and post-process the output (such as by applying spectral smoothing or scaling the spectrum). You may also need to handle more complex data types, such as multi-channel audio signals or time-varying spectra.

This will perform an FFT on a sine wave and print the resulting frequency spectrum to the console.

### Compile Instructions

compiled and run on a Raspberry Pi. To compile the code, you will need to install the Kiss FFT library on your Raspberry Pi. You can do this by downloading the Kiss FFT source code from the website (http://kissfft.sourceforge.net/) and then building and installing it using the following commands:

tar xvf kiss_fft130.tar.gz
cd kiss_fft130
./configure
make
make install

> Once the library is installed, you can compile the code using the gcc compiler:

gcc -o fft fft.c -lm -lkissfft

> You can then run the compiled executable using the following command:

./fft
