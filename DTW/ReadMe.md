#### Dynamic Programming

* we are to find the minimum-cost path through matrix `dist_matrix` using dynamic programming
> Cost of a Path:

Defined as the sum of the matrix entries on that path

> The Sequence of Operation is as follows

1. Define the shape of the signal x,y and visualize
2. Define the distance matrix
3. Define the Dynamic Time Warp - `path` and `cost` function and visualize
4. Plot a distance and cost matrix subplot
